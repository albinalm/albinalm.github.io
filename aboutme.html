                I am a 22 year old programmer from Alingsås, Sweden.
                Today I am studying .NET-Development at Teknikhögskolan - Gothenburg
                <br>
                My programming interest ignited when I was around twelve years old and tried to create my own music
                player.
                Young and naive I believed that there would be some drag and drop application for me to fulfill my
                desire.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unprepared I stumbled across Visual Basic and opened my first project.
                Not even knowing it was programming I followed YouTube-tutorials and Stackoverflow-guides to patch
                together my first application.
                Stubborn as I am, I finally managed to finish my very own music player. The feeling of accomplishement
                is what ignited my flame, but also what fuels it even today.
                <br>
                Driven by the desire to help others create their software ideas(just like I once wanted), drove me into
                creating CodeIndent.
                <br><br>
