            CodeIntent is a forge for manufacturing your software dreams!
            Our ambition is to help you or your company achieve digital solutions perfect for a specific endeavor.
            <br>
            We know it's difficult to find existing applications to suit all your needs, therefore we know people and
            companies often instead use several of them to try cover all possible ground.
            <br>
            We also know many people and companies have great ideas that would suite them and maybe their clients
            perfectly, but doesn't have the competence to make it happen.
            <br>
            Driven by this idea is what made Forgify happen. You give us the details, and through fire and flames we
            forge your idea into reality.
